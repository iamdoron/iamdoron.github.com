##The Stretch Philosophy 101

Usually we stretch, we push to make it to the next level, we try to squeeze the most we can - Because we want to be better. Sometimes I get caught up with that state of mind; ‘I only need to stretch more each day and I’ll make it’. I’ll make what?

To illustrate *a point I still haven’t made*, let's talk about [Tahini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahini). <br>
When you prepare Tahini you usually take some 'Raw Tahini' (thick, ground, sesame seed fluid) and water. You mix both, add some spices and olive oil. The first time you try to prepare Tahini, if nobody told you otherwise, you would probably just pour the water and the raw Tahini to a ball and mix them. That's when you find yourself in a weird spot. It doesn't work; I remember myself mixing and mixing and mixing and mixing and mixing. Eventually, you learn; you learn that you pour the water __slowly__, __gradually__, you learn that you actually don’t need a lot of water. Today, I found myself amazed by how fast I can prepare Tahini compared to my first time. Something happened. I learned the magic.

Couple of weeks ago, I told my yoga instructor I want to practice at home to reach the [lotus position (padmāsana)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_position). I felt I'm so far from the asana, and there was such a huge difference between my left and right side. He showed me a simple position to 'stretch' (at least that's how I *perceived* it back then) the joint that connects the thigh to the hip. The stretch is really good - I actually really like that pose (It's called [Sucirandhrasana](http://yoga.about.com/od/yogaposes/a/Eye-Of-The-Needle-Pose-Sucirandhrasana.htm)). <br>
Anyhow, I was practicing it everyday for two weeks. In my mind, I was stretching, trying to achive 'the higher stretch', trying to 'fix' my not-so-flexible joints. I thought - it's like a prescription, do this every day and let the *jagged little pill* do its job; wait for the dust to settle. Just to be clear, it does make you flexible, but that's a *second order* effect. After two weeks I realized I was beginning to *learn* how to move my joints in a place and a context I didn't know exist. It’s not just a stretch. The asana puts you in a position where you have no choice but to learn how to move your body, and more specifically, the joint that connects the thigh to the hip.
<br>My eureka moment was when I compered my better (right) side to the left side - suddenly I noticed that my right side just *knows* how to move the joint. It learned it long ago, when I wasn't aware of it. It's not just a stretch.

Each time I lose my sense of direction, and rely *only* on ‘trying to be flexible’, ‘trying to be stronger’, ‘trying to complete the job’, ‘just another push and you can make it’, there’s this new *perception* I acquired; I realise I’m learning how to use my body (to be flexible, to be stronger), I learn when I complete a task at work, I learn from yoga, I’m not just stretching. And to be clear, it’s not just a thought, it’s a perception we can sharpen. [You Learn](www.youtube.com/embed/T1tOHz2l0qE).
