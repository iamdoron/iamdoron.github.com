## A True Yogi Has No Quest
We're not in a *quest* to find the 'essence', 'enlightenment' (maybe allignment). We're here to listen, to observe, to be. That's why when I'm talking about an essence, I talk about my observations, trying to see things as they are. Don't take it too seriously, and have your own experience be your guide.

## 99 Percent Practice, 1 Percent Theory Enough
The words of the late Astanga's Guruji, Sri K. Pattabhi Jois:

> Yes, 99% practice.

> Practical experience is not coming - yoga is no.

> You experience, you want to experience.

> That's why 99% and have practice - 1% theory enough.

> Theory, don't understand it-

> Practice, practice, practice, practice.

> After - gradually, gradually, theory also understanding.

> You don't practice - __no yoga__.

## Mūla Bandha

As we said earlier, you have to (99%) experience it yourself, so I won't bore you with much [theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mula_Bandha).

Mūla Bandha appears almost in any assana. Usually you don't fully lock it, which means you can preserve the Bandha lock for most of the practice.

> [As] Yoga practitioner, you must take mulabandha.

> Mūla Bandha means the anus control.

> Mūla Bandha you always take.

> Sitting time, talking time, walking time, eating time - all the time...

> Automatically, gradually, is coming [comes] your Mūla Bandha

> After - gradually, gradually, theory also understanding.

> Without Mūla Bandha - __no yoga__.

This guy might help you visualize it (he also adds Uḍḍiyāna Bandha to the mix, and he has the same name as I do)

## Breathing

Now, use your Mūla Bandha, and let's watch a typical astanga practice
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ttRaZkigQmQ?start=108&end=122" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="display:block;"></iframe>


> ekam (1), inhale

> dve (2), exhale

> treeni (3), inhale

> chatvaari (4), jump back [and please exhale]

Breathing makes everything much easier, comfortable. Breathing is part of what unlocks the way to "Sthira Sukam Asanam" (steady, comfortable poses).

## Wait! That's It? What About Technique/Flexibility/Strength/Focus?

If you _practice_, if you _breathe_, if you use your _Mūla Bandha_, that's the essence. If you have a 'quest', let it be one of those. Oh, and of course, have a teacher, someone to pass you down this important 1% of theory.

My yoga teacher once told me he watched Sri K. Pattabhi Jois' grandson, Sharath (I can't fined this specific video), and he wondered - Sharath wasn't perfect (in his technique). Then my teacher suddenly realised, this his 'quest' for technique was not the essence; he saw Sharath use his _Mūla Bandha_, _breathe_. It's as simple as that. Sometimes we see an end and we make it the means.
